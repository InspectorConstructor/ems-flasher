Technical notes on the 64 Mbit "USB GB Smart Card" from EMS

Composition of the cartridge
   The cartridge is composed of 64 MBit (8 MB) of flash memory, 128 KB of
   static RAM that is backed up by a battery and of a custom MBC5 memory
   controller.

Programming the EMS cartridge via USB
   The device is identified by these VID:PID: 0x4670:0x9394. Note that several
   devices from EMS share the same identifier.

   Two interfaces are used: Interface 1 is the read end and Interface 2 is the
   write end. Transfers are made in bulk.

   Commands are sent on Interface 2. They have a fixed size of 9 bytes and
   follow this format:
      offset 0 (1 byte): Opcode
      offset 1 (4 bytes, Big Endian):  Address (in bytes) 
      offset 5 (4 bytes, Big Endian):  Length (in bytes) 

   Opcodes:
      0xff: read data from the flash memory
      0x6d: read data from SRAM
      0x57: write data to the flash memory
      0x4d: write data to SRAM

   A Write operation is followed directly by the data. The data resulting from
   a Read operation is read from Interface 1.

   The flash memory is byte addressable. Addresses range from 0 to 0x7fffff
   (8 MB). The first page sits in the first 4 MB.

   The flashing software provided by EMS reads data by chunk of 4096 bytes and
   writes data by chunk of 32 bytes and accesses are aligned to the chunk size.

   A Read operation will block if an odd number of Write operations has been
   previously made.

   The flash memory is an Intel StrataFlash J3 composed of 64 erase-blocks of
   128 KB (1 MBit). An erase-block is erased (all the bits are set to 1) by
   writing data at its beginning. The erasure operation takes about 1 second.
   Each erase-block has a life of 100000 erase cycles.

   It is normally not possible to write data twice to the same location
   without erasing the target block beforehand. There is an exception: writing
   a chunk of 32 bytes of zeros to a an already written location will have the
   desired effect.
